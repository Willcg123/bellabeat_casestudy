# Prepare
### Load Packages
```{r Load Packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(dplyr)

library(ggpubr)
```

### Data 
The following data is found from the [Fitbit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit) on Kaggle. This data set contains personal fitness tracker information from thirty fitbit users. 

```{r reading data}
dailyActivity <- read.csv("C:/Users/willg/OneDrive/Rstudio/Bellabeat Case Study/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyActivity_merged.csv")

sleepDay <- read.csv("C:/Users/willg/OneDrive/Rstudio/Bellabeat Case Study/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/sleepDay_merged.csv")


hourlySteps <- read.csv("C:/Users/willg/OneDrive/Rstudio/Bellabeat Case Study/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/hourlySteps_merged.csv")

hourlyCalories <- read.csv("C:/Users/willg/OneDrive/Rstudio/Bellabeat Case Study/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/hourlyCalories_merged.csv")

hourlyIntensities <- read.csv("C:/Users/willg/OneDrive/Rstudio/Bellabeat Case Study/Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/hourlyIntensities_merged.csv")

```

### Observing the Data
Lets take a quick look at the first few rows of each data set.
```{r observing data}
head(dailyActivity,3)
head(hourlyCalories,3)
head(hourlyIntensities,3)
head(hourlySteps,3)
head(sleepDay,3)
```
### Cleaning the Data
Next I will make sure that there are no duplicates in each of the data frames.
```{r finding duplicates}
sum(duplicated(dailyActivity))
sum(duplicated(hourlySteps))
sum(duplicated(hourlyCalories))
sum(duplicated(hourlyIntensities))
sum(duplicated(sleepDay))
```

I see that sleepDay has 3 duplicates so now I will remove these duplicates so it won't affect my analysis.
```{r removing duplicates}
sleepDay <- sleepDay %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  drop_na()
```

Now I will check to make sure that the duplicates are removed 
```{r checking if duplicates are removed}
sum(duplicated(sleepDay))
```
Now I will observe how many distinct Ids there are to see how many users data I am looking at 
```{r seeing number of users}
n_distinct(dailyActivity$Id)
n_distinct(hourlySteps$Id)
n_distinct(hourlyCalories$Id)
n_distinct(hourlyIntensities$Id)
n_distinct(sleepDay$Id)
```

# Process 
### Transforming the data 
After seeing the columns in each of the data sets I will rename and transform some of the columns to be able to merge them later on. 
```{r renaming columns}
dailyActivity <- dailyActivity %>% 
  rename(date=ActivityDate)

hourlySteps <- hourlySteps %>% 
  rename(date=ActivityHour)

hourlyCalories <- hourlyCalories %>% 
  rename(date=ActivityHour)

hourlyIntensities <- hourlyIntensities %>% 
  rename(date=ActivityHour)

sleepDay <- sleepDay %>% 
  rename(date=SleepDay)
```

Now I will transform the date format for merging. 
```{r fixing formating of dates}
dailyActivity <- dailyActivity %>% 
  mutate(date= as.Date(date, format = "%m/%d/%Y"))

hourlySteps <- hourlySteps %>% 
  mutate(date= as.POSIXct(date,format ="%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p" , tz=Sys.timezone()))

hourlyIntensities <- hourlyIntensities %>% 
  mutate(date= as.POSIXct(date,format ="%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p" , tz=Sys.timezone()))

hourlyCalories <- hourlyCalories %>% 
  mutate(date= as.POSIXct(date,format ="%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p" , tz=Sys.timezone()))

sleepDay <- sleepDay %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(date,format ="%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p" , tz=Sys.timezone()))
```

Next I will merge the hourly data into one data frame named: hourlyActivity
```{r joining hourly data}
hourlyActivity <- hourlySteps %>% 
  left_join(hourlyIntensities, by=c("Id", "date")) %>% 
  left_join(hourlyCalories, by=c("Id", "date"))
  
head(hourlyActivity)
```
Now I will separate the date into date and time for hourlyActivity.
```{r separating date into time and date columns}
hourlyActivity <- hourlyActivity %>% 
  separate(date, into =c("date", "time"), sep = " ")

head(hourlyActivity)
```

# Analyze and Share
In this step I will answer the questions using the data that I have just cleaned and transformed. 

Referring back to the questions they are:

1. What are some trends in smart device usage?

2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?

3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy? 

### Usage each day
First let us start with how many users used the Fitbit each day. I will do this by observing daily step activity and removing the days where there were 0 steps because that means the device was not used. 
```{r removing 0 values and observing users by date}
# Removing 0s 
dailyActivity_zero <- filter_at(dailyActivity, vars("TotalSteps"), all_vars((.) !=0))

#Creating a new data frame for number of users by date
dailyUsers <- dailyActivity_zero %>% 
  group_by(date) %>% 
  summarize(user_perday = sum(n()), .groups="drop")

dailyUsers <- dailyUsers %>% 
  mutate(date= as.Date(date, format = "%m/%d/%Y"))
  
```

I will create a heatmap calendar showing how many users used the Fitbit each day to see if there is any relationship between certain days of the week and number of users as well as if there are any relationships between length of use and number of users. 
```{r calendar heatmap on users}
calendarPlot(dailyUsers, pollutant = "user_perday", year = 2016, month = 4:5,  cex.lim = c(0.6, 1), main = "Number of Users by Day", cols=c("green", "yellow", "orange", "red"), key.header = "Number of Users", key.position = "top")
options(repr.plot.width = 14, repr.plot.height = 10)
```
```{r summary of amount of users per day}
summary(dailyUsers$user_perday)
```


Looking at the data from the 31 day period I can pinpoint a few key features. 

* Of the total 33 Ids observed an average of 28 users use the device on any given day.

* However, looking at the heatmap there is a clear decline in usage during the second half of the period.

### Steps Taken By Weekday
Next I will look at the average amount of steps taken each day of the week. This will be done by grouping the number of steps taken each day and then separating each date into the corresponding day of the week. 
```{r finding avg daily steps per weekday }
dailyActivity_zero <- dailyActivity_zero %>%
    mutate(day = weekdays(as.Date(date, format = "%m/%d/%Y")))

avg_steps_weekday <- dailyActivity_zero %>% 
  group_by(day) %>% 
  summarize(avg_steps = mean(TotalSteps))

avg_steps_weekday$day <- ordered(avg_steps_weekday$day, levels=c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday",
"Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"))

avg_steps_weekday <- avg_steps_weekday %>%
arrange(day)

avg_steps_weekday
```
In the data calculation I used the dailyActivity with 0 values removed because that indicates that the device was not used. This allows me to have a more accurate mean value because it doesn't take into account the variables with 0 daily steps. 

```{r}
avg_step_bar_chart <- ggplot(avg_steps_weekday) +
  geom_col(aes(x=day, y=avg_steps), fill="#83adb5") +
  labs(title="Average Steps by Weekday", x="", y="") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=35, vjust=1, hjust=1))

avg_step_bar_chart
```

* Friday and Sunday has lower average steps. 

### Daily Usage of Device, Day and Night
Next I will observe the daily usage of Fitbits based on the weekday for both during the day (steps) and during the night (sleep). I will use two bar charts and compare the number of uses by day. 
```{r daily usage of fitbit during the day}
step_activity_by_day <- dailyActivity_zero %>%
    group_by(day) %>%
    summarize(days_used = n()) %>%
    arrange(day)

step_activity_by_day$day <-ordered(step_activity_by_day$day, levels=c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday",
"Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"))

step_activity_by_day <- step_activity_by_day %>%
    arrange(day)

step_activity_by_day
```
```{r}
sleep_activity_by_day <- sleepDay %>% 
  mutate(day=weekdays(as.Date(date, format="%m/%d/%Y")))

sleep_activity_by_day <- sleep_activity_by_day %>% 
  group_by(day) %>% 
  summarize(days_used=n()) %>% 
  arrange(day)

sleep_activity_by_day$day <- ordered(sleep_activity_by_day$day, levels=c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"))

sleep_activity_by_day <- sleep_activity_by_day %>% 
  arrange(day)

sleep_activity_by_day

```
Next I will put this data into a bar chart and compare them. 
```{r}
step_activity_by_day_graph <- ggplot(data=step_activity_by_day) +
  geom_col(aes(x=day, y=days_used), fill="#6D435A")+
  labs(title="Use During Day by Weekday") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=35, vjust=1, hjust=1))

sleep_activity_by_day_graph <- ggplot(data=sleep_activity_by_day) + 
  geom_col(aes(x=day, y=days_used),fill="#484D6D") +
  labs(title="Use During Night by Weekday") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=35, vjust=1, hjust=1))

ggarrange(step_activity_by_day_graph, sleep_activity_by_day_graph)
```

* More than half the users stop using the Fitbit when sleeping
* Sunday and Monday see a drop in usage compared to the middle of the week


### Daily Steps and Calories
Now I will look at daily steps and calories to see if there is any relationship between the two variables. 

```{r}
daily_steps_calories_graph <- ggplot(data=dailyActivity_zero)+
  geom_point(aes(x=TotalSteps, y=Calories)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x=TotalSteps, y=Calories)) +
  ggtitle("Daily Steps vs. Daily Calories")

daily_steps_calories_graph
```

* Strong correlation with total steps and calories

### Sedentary Minutes 
Next I will look at sedentary minutes compared to calories and steps as well as total sedentary time per day of the week with scatter points and a smooth graph putting them side by side to observe the relationship between sedentary minutes and steps and calories.
```{r}
sedentary_calories_graph <- ggplot(data=dailyActivity_zero) +
  geom_point(aes(x=SedentaryMinutes, y=Calories)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x=SedentaryMinutes, y=Calories)) +
  ggtitle("Sedentary Minutes vs. Daily Calories")

sedentary_steps_graph <- ggplot(data=dailyActivity_zero) +
  geom_point(aes(x=SedentaryMinutes, y=TotalSteps)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x=SedentaryMinutes, y=TotalSteps)) +
  ggtitle("Sedentary Minutes vs. Daily Steps")

ggarrange(sedentary_calories_graph, sedentary_steps_graph)
```

* Strongly suggests that after about 1000 Sedentary Minutes daily steps and calories burned drop significantly

Now I will look at total Sedentary Minutes for each day of the week. 
```{r}
sedentary_minutes_by_day <- dailyActivity_zero %>% 
  mutate(day=weekdays(as.Date(date, format="%m/%d/%Y")))

sedentary_minutes_by_day <- sedentary_minutes_by_day %>% 
  group_by(day) %>% 
  summarize(avg_sed_min=mean(SedentaryMinutes)) %>% 
  arrange(day)

sedentary_minutes_by_day$day <- ordered(sedentary_minutes_by_day$day, levels=c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"))

sedentary_minutes_by_day <- sedentary_minutes_by_day %>% 
  arrange(day)

sedentary_minutes_by_day
```
```{r}
avg_sed_min_chart <- ggplot(sedentary_minutes_by_day) +
  geom_col(aes(x=day, y=avg_sed_min), fill="maroon") +
  labs(title="Average Sedentary Minutes By Weekday", x="", y="Sedentary Minutes") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=35, vjust=1, hjust=1))

avg_sed_min_chart
```

* Monday and Friday have high average sedentary minutes
* Some factors that can contributeis work and relaxation relating to Mondays and Fridays

### Hourly Activity
Finally, I will look at the different levels of hourly activity that could show insight and relationships between variables valuable to our analysis.

```{r}
step_int_hr <- hourlyActivity %>% 
  group_by(time) %>% 
  summarize(avg_step_hr=mean(StepTotal), avg_int_hr=mean(TotalIntensity)) %>% arrange(time)

step_int_hr
```


```{r}
step_hr_chart <- ggplot(data=step_int_hr) +
  geom_col(aes(x=time, y=avg_step_hr, fill=avg_int_hr)) +
  labs(title="Average Steps Each Hour of the Day", x="Hour", y="Steps", fill="Intensity Each Hour") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90, vjust=1, hjust=1))

step_hr_chart
```

* Strong correlation between hourly number of steps and hourly intensity
* See a strong dip in steps at 14:00:00 indicating lower amount of active time during that hour
* Could be due to it being after lunch time and/or while people are working

# Act: Recommendations
### Back to the guiding questions

1. What are some trends in smart device usage?

2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?

3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?

### Recommendations
We already know, Bellabeat is a company that empowers women to be the best versions of themselves and that should be reflected in their smart devices as well. However, the wearable smart device market is rapidly growing and already has a lot of competition. After looking at the data from Fitbit  I found some insight that can influence the marketing strategy for their wearable smart technology.

1. **Promote consistent wearing:** One of the biggest outcomes that I found from the dataset was that many of the Fitbit users stopped using it after the first half of the month. For whatever reasons they didn't put it on again and the uses continued to go down as the days went on. Bellabeat needs to be able to promote consistent wearing whether it is app notifications and/or encouragement and goal setting. We want the users to be able to be exited to put the device on everyday and make it part of their daily routine.

2. **Encourage use at night:** Another factor that I found from the data was that many users don't use the Fitbit at night. This could also be a factor of less use after the first half month. We could do this by providing more incentive for sleep at night by promoting such as giving more detailed health recommendations based off sleep and also promoting better sleeping habits with personal user data. 

3. **Increase use on weekends:** In the data there was a large decrease in daily use on the weekends and Monday. This indicates many users weren't using the device on the weekends and weren't exercising as well. Therefore we can encourage more exercise on weekends through app integration and encourage more activity on the weekends and Monday.

4. **Decrease sedentary time and Increase steps after meals:** I found that as sedentary time increases past 1000 minutes the total number of calories burned goes down drastically. In addition, there is a dip in hourly steps at 2:00 pm and 8:00 pm indicating that users aren't doing as much exercise after meal times. Using this information we can increase activity during these times to decrease overall sedentary time as well as increase step and intensity activity after meals. 

5. **Personalize:** Finally, the most important step to do is personalize and provide daily notifications and advice. Use past data and track health and wellness information with the application and provide feedback to encourage healthier behaviors. In addition, provide insights to the health benefits and show how a personalized health tracking device can lead to healthier and happier life. 

Bellabeat has a lot of tools and data they can use to better their smart technology. However, even with data from other wearable technologies we still must conduct further research using data from our own products. This will give us furhter insight and can provide more accurate information for our customers.
